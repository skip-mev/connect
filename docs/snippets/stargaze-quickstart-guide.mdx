**The required version for Connect with Stargaze is `v1.0.12`.**

You need to configure a custom API endpoint for use with the Osmosis provider, `https://rest.osmosis-1.interchain-apis.com`.
Set the following `oracle.json` configuration file. **Keep the file path handy** as we will pass it into a flag when running Connect.

```json oracle.json
{
  "providers": {
    "osmosis_api": {
      "api": {
        "endpoints": [
          {"url": "https://rest.osmosis-1.interchain-apis.com"}
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
 With the `oracle.json` file path, enter the following command to run Connect.

```shell
connect \
--market-map-endpoint="<YOUR_NODE_GRPC_URL>:<YOUR_NODE_GRPC_PORT>" \
--oracle-config path/to/oracle.json
```
