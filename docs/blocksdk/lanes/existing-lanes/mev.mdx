<Info>

TLDR

The `MEV Lane` allows top-of-block MEV auctions in-protocol, with revenue being redistributed to chains.

If you have not already, we recommend following the [General Setup](/docs/blocksdk/0-integrate-the-sdk.md) guide first!

Please [**reach out to us**](https://skip.money/contact) if you need help!

### üí∞ Overview

Blockspace is valuable, and MEV bots find arbitrage opportunities to capture value. The `MEV Lane` provides a fair auction for these by leveraging the `x/auction` module. The `MEVLane` ensures that proposals are constructed in accordance with the `x/auction`'s view of all bids, and the `x/auction` is responsible for ordering bids + keeping track of bids + selecting auction winners.

The Block SDK uses the app-side `LanedMempool`, `PrepareLane` / `ProcessLane`, and `CheckTx` to create an MEV marketplace inside the protocol. It introduces a new message type, called a `MsgAuctionBid`, that allows the submitter to execute multiple transactions at the **top of the block atomically** atomically.

<Note>
**atomicity** here refers to **transaction inclusion** and not **transaction execution**. The `x/auction` module does not make any guarantees for atomic execution, some transactions in a bundle may fail!!
</Note>

This means that ‚Äòsearchers‚Äô can find opportunities in the mempool, backrun them, and submit them at the top of the block. This covers most MEV recapture via arbitrage, liquidations, backrunning, oracle-updates, etc. It can be configured to **not allow** for sandwich attacks or harmful MEV.

### üìñ Set Up [10 mins]

**At a high level, to integrate the MEV Lane, chains must:**

1. Be using Cosmos SDK version or higher `v0.47.0`.
2. Import and configure the `MEV Lane` (alongside any other desired lanes) into their base app.
3. Import and configure the Block SDK mempool into their base app.
4. Import and configure the Block SDK `Prepare` / `Process` proposal handlers into their base app.
5. Import and instantiate the `x/auction` module into their base app.

# üèóÔ∏è MEV Lane Setup

## üì¶ Dependencies

The Block SDK is built on top of the Cosmos SDK. The Block SDK is currently
compatible with Cosmos SDK versions greater than or equal to `v0.47.0`.

The `MEVLane` requires that apps use the `LanedMempool` as their app-side mempool, see [here](/docs/blocksdk/0-integrate-the-sdk.md)

### Release Compatibility Matrix

| Block SDK Version | Cosmos SDK |
| :---------------: | :--------: |
|     `v1.x.x`      | `v0.47.x`  |
|     `v2.x.x`      | `v0.50.x`  |

## üì• Installation

To install the Block SDK, run the following command:

```bash
$ go install github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk
```

## üìö Usage

1. This guide assumes you have already set up the [Block SDK (and the default lane)](https://docs.skip.money/chains/overview)
2. You will need to instantiate the `x/auction` module into your application. This
   module is responsible for processing auction transactions and distributing revenue
   to the auction house. The `x/auction` module is also responsible for ensuring the
   validity of auction transactions, and maintaining the set of bids / revenue distribution.
   The `MEVLane` is responsible for constructing blocks with transactions from the winning bid.
3. Next, add the MEV lane into the `lane` object on your `app.go`. The first
   lane is the highest priority lane and the last lane is the lowest priority lane.
   Since the MEV lane is meant to auction off the top of the block, **it should be
   the highest priority lane**. The default lane should follow.
4. You will also need to create a `PrepareProposalHandler` and a
   `ProcessProposalHandler` that will be responsible for preparing and processing
   proposals respectively. Configure the order of the lanes in the
   `PrepareProposalHandler` and `ProcessProposalHandler` to match the order of the
   lanes in the `LanedMempool`.

NOTE: This example walks through setting up the MEV and Default lanes.

1. Import the necessary dependencies into your application. This includes the
   Block SDK proposal handlers + mempool, keeper, auction types, and auction
   module. This tutorial will go into more detail into each of the dependencies.

   ```go
   import (
    ...
    "github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk/abci"
    "github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk/lanes/mev"
    "github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk/lanes/base"
    auctionmodule "github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk/x/auction"
    auctionkeeper "github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk/x/auction/keeper"
    auctiontypes "github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk/x/auction/types"
    auctionante "github.com/skip-mev/block-sdk/x/auction/ante"
     ...
   )
   ```

2. Add the `x/auction` module to the the `AppModuleBasic` manager. This manager is in
   charge of setting up basic, non-dependent module elements such as codec
   registration and genesis verification. This will register the special
   `MsgAuctionBid` message. When users want to bid for top of block execution,
   they will submit a transaction - which we call an auction transaction - that
   includes a single `MsgAuctionBid`. We prevent any other messages from being
   included in auction transaction to prevent malicious behavior - such as front
   running or sandwiching.

   ```go
   var (
     ModuleBasics = module.NewBasicManager(
       ...
       auctionmodule.AppModuleBasic{},
     )
     ...
   )
   ```

3. The auction `Keeper` is MEV lane's gateway to processing special `MsgAuctionBid`
   messages that allow users to participate in the top of block auction, distribute
   revenue to the auction house, and ensure the validity of auction transactions.

   a. First add the keeper to the app's struct definition. We also want to add
   MEV lane's custom checkTx handler to the app's struct definition. This will
   allow us to override the default checkTx handler to process bid transactions
   before they are inserted into the `LanedMempool`. NOTE: The custom handler
   is required as otherwise the auction can be held hostage by a malicious
   users.

   ```go
   type App struct {
   ...
   // auctionKeeper is the keeper that handles processing auction transactions
   AuctionKeeper         auctionkeeper.Keeper

   // Custom checkTx handler
   checkTxHandler mev.CheckTx
   }
   ```

   b. Add the auction module to the list of module account permissions. This will
   instantiate the auction module account on genesis.

   ```go
   maccPerms = map[string][]string{
   auction.ModuleName: nil,
   ...
   }
   ```

   c. Instantiate the Block SDK's `LanedMempool` with the application's
   desired lanes.

   ```go
   // 1. Create the lanes.
   //
   // NOTE: The lanes are ordered by priority. The first lane is the
   // highest priority
   // lane and the last lane is the lowest priority lane. Top of block
   // lane allows transactions to bid for inclusion at the top of the next block.
   //
   // For more information on how to utilize the LaneConfig please
   // visit the README in docs.skip.money/chains/lanes/build-your-own-lane#-lane-config.
   //
   // MEV lane hosts an auction at the top of the block.
   mevConfig := base.LaneConfig{
       Logger:        app.Logger(),
       TxEncoder:     app.txConfig.TxEncoder(),
       TxDecoder:     app.txConfig.TxDecoder(),
       MaxBlockSpace: math.LegacyZeroDec(),
       MaxTxs:        0,
   }
   mevLane := mev.NewMEVLane(
       mevConfig,
       mev.NewDefaultAuctionFactory(app.txConfig.TxDecoder()),
   )

   // default lane accepts all other transactions.
   defaultConfig := base.LaneConfig{
       Logger:        app.Logger(),
       TxEncoder:     app.txConfig.TxEncoder(),
       TxDecoder:     app.txConfig.TxDecoder(),
       MaxBlockSpace: math.LegacyZeroDec(),
       MaxTxs:        0,
   }
   defaultLane := base.NewStandardLane(defaultConfig)

   // 2. Set up the relative priority of lanes
   lanes := []block.Lane{
       mevLane,
       defaultLane,
   }
   mempool := block.NewLanedMempool(app.Logger(), true, lanes...)
   app.App.SetMempool(mempool)
   ```

   d. Add the `x/auction` module's `AuctionDecorator` to the ante-handler
   chain. The `AuctionDecorator` is an AnteHandler decorator that enforces
   various chain configurable MEV rules.

   ```go
   anteDecorators := []sdk.AnteDecorator{
       ante.NewSetUpContextDecorator(),
       ...
       auctionante.NewauctionDecorator(
       options.auctionKeeper,
       options.TxEncoder,
       options.TOBLane,
       options.Mempool,
       ),
   }

   anteHandler := sdk.ChainAnteDecorators(anteDecorators...)
   app.SetAnteHandler(anteHandler)

   // Set the antehandlers on the lanes.
   //
   // NOTE: This step is required as otherwise the lanes will not be able to
   // process auction transactions.
   for _, lane := range lanes {
       lane.SetAnteHandler(anteHandler)
   }
   app.App.SetAnteHandler(anteHandler)
   ```

   e. Instantiate the auction keeper, store keys, and module manager. Note, be
   sure to do this after all the required keeper dependencies have been instantiated.

   ```go
   keys := storetypes.NewKVStoreKeys(
       auctiontypes.StoreKey,
       ...
   )

   ...
   app.auctionKeeper := auctionkeeper.NewKeeper(
       appCodec,
       keys[auctiontypes.StoreKey],
       app.AccountKeeper,
       app.BankKeeper,
       app.DistrKeeper,
       app.StakingKeeper,
       authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govv1.ModuleName).String(),
   )


   app.ModuleManager = module.NewManager(
       auction.NewAppModule(appCodec, app.auctionKeeper),
       ...
   )
   ```

   f. Configure the proposal/checkTx handlers on base app.

   ```go
   // Create the proposal handler that will be used to build and validate blocks.
   proposalHandler := abci.NewProposalHandler(
       app.Logger(),
       app.txConfig.TxDecoder(),
       mempool,
   )
   app.App.SetPrepareProposal(proposalHandler.PrepareProposalHandler())
   app.App.SetProcessProposal(proposalHandler.ProcessProposalHandler())

   // Set the custom CheckTx handler on BaseApp.
   checkTxHandler := mev.NewCheckTxHandler(
       app.App,
       app.txConfig.TxDecoder(),
       mevLane,
       anteHandler,
   )
   app.SetCheckTx(checkTxHandler.CheckTx())

   // CheckTx will check the transaction with the provided checkTxHandler.
   // We override the default handler so that we can verify transactions
   // before they are inserted into the mempool. With the CheckTx, we can
   // verify the bid transaction and all of the bundled transactions
   // before inserting the bid transaction into the mempool.
   func (app *TestApp) CheckTx(req *cometabci.RequestCheckTx)
       (*cometabci.ResponseCheckTx, error) {
       return app.checkTxHandler(req)
   }

   // SetCheckTx sets the checkTxHandler for the app.
   func (app *TestApp) SetCheckTx(handler mev.CheckTx) {
       app.checkTxHandler = handler
   }
   ```

   g. Finally, update the app's `InitGenesis` order.

   ```go
   genesisModuleOrder := []string{
       auctiontypes.ModuleName,
       ...,
   }
   ```

## Params

- **MaxBundleSize** - What is the maximal number of transactions a bundle can have?
- **EscrowAccountAddress** - Where does the chain collect bid revenue? Notice, this is an `sdk.AccAdress` and is configured on genesis, or via `ParamChange` proposals.
- **ReserveFee** - The minimum possible bid. Notice, no bids less than the `ReserveFee` will be accepted.
- **MinBidIncrement** - This is the minimum difference from the max bid that `x/auction` module will accept. I.e if the current max bid is `12ujuno`, and `MinBidIncrement = 1`, then all new bids must be greater than `13ujuno` to be considered.
- **FrontRunningProtection** - This determines whether front-running bundles will be accepted by the `x/auction` module
- **ProposerFee** - This is a fractional value, i.e `0 <= ProposerFee <= 1`, this determines how much of the winning bid from the previous block goes to the proposer of that block, the rest will be sent to the `EscrowAccountAddress`
