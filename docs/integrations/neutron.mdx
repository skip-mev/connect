## FAQs

### **Q: How do I get up and running?**

**A:** Here is a quick (5-10 minutes) step-by-step breakdown. Please reach out to us at [skip.money/discord](http://skip.money/discord) if you have questions!

1. **Download the Connect binary.**

   The best way to get the Connect binary is in the GitHub releases page for Connect.

   https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/releases/tag/v1.0.1

   The initial version required for Neutron is [`v1.0.1+`](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/releases/tag/v1.0.1)

   We also provide a container image at [ghcr.io/skip-mev/slinky-sidecar](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/pkgs/container/slinky-sidecar/232941439?tag=v1.0.3)

   This will include the Connect binary, `slinky`

2. **Integrate the Connect sidecar into your setup.**

   To run connect with stable defaults defined by the skip team

   ```bash
   slinky
   ```

   > Notice, some default values may need to change depending on how you've setup your node + connect-sidecar. See the **marketmap-provider** [section](/validator/flags-guide#marketmap-provider) of the [flags-guide](/validator/flags-guide)

3. **Point your chain binary at your Connect instance**

   The chain binary has been altered to accept new options which are used to configure your application. The following options in `app.toml` are relevant to Connect operation.

   ```toml
   ###############################################################################
   ###                                  Oracle                                 ###
   ###############################################################################
   [oracle]
   # Enabled indicates whether the oracle is enabled.
   enabled = "true"

   # Oracle Address is the URL of the out of process oracle sidecar. This is used to
   # connect to the oracle sidecar when the application boots up. Note that the address
   # can be modified at any point, but will only take effect after the application is
   # restarted. This can be the address of an oracle container running on the same
   # machine or a remote machine.
   oracle_address = "localhost:8080"

   # Client Timeout is the time that the client is willing to wait for responses from
   # the oracle before timing out.
   client_timeout = "2s"

   # MetricsEnabled determines whether oracle metrics are enabled. Specifically
   # this enables intsrumentation of the oracle client and the interaction between
   # the oracle and the app.
   metrics_enabled = "true"
   ```

# FAQ

### **Q: How do I know if my validator is properly fetching prices and posting them to the chain?**

**A:** A full set of prometheus metrics are integrated into both the sidecar and the chain application binary.

A comprehensive overview of the relevant metrics is hosted in the root [metrics.md](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/blob/262fddc8ff1335c87886cf7aacce2efea8164246/metrics.md).

A further breakdown of metrics are listed in the Connect repo, categorized by subsystem:

- [Application-Side Metrics](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/blob/a6577aa779f1f98c47ec95d626e4af70949af7b1/service/metrics/README.md)
- [General Oracle Sidecar Metrics](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/blob/a6577aa779f1f98c47ec95d626e4af70949af7b1/oracle/metrics/README.md)
- [Sidecar Provider Metrics](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/blob/a6577aa779f1f98c47ec95d626e4af70949af7b1/providers/base/metrics/README.md)
- [API Provider Metrics](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/blob/a6577aa779f1f98c47ec95d626e4af70949af7b1/providers/base/api/metrics/README.md)
- [Websocket Provider Metrics](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/blob/a6577aa779f1f98c47ec95d626e4af70949af7b1/providers/base/websocket/metrics/README.md)

Additionally, the logs from your chain node binary will contain the following error if it is unable to connect to the sidecar to grab prices:

`Failed to run fetch prices for slinky daemon`

### **Q: How do I upgrade the sidecar binary?**

**A:** Upgrading the sidecar can be done out of band of the chain’s binary. If you have a load balancer, CNAME, etc., in front of your sidecar you can simply start up the new version and switch out which version traffic is being directed to during live chain validation.

If you are running the Connect sidecar in a container you can shut down the container, pull the updated container image and relaunch your container to update.

If you are running the binary via systemd or other management tool, you will need to stop the process and re-launch using the newly released binary.

### **Q: Can I reuse my sidecar if other ICS chains, or the Cosmos Hub, uses Connect?**

**A:** Yes! We don't currently have docs on how to do this, but as soon as another ICS chain or the Hub votes to include Connect, it will be as simple as pointing your chain binary to the same sidecar over gRPC.

### **Q: Will I be rewarded for running Connect?**

**A:** Yes! The Neutron team has committed to offering rewards in $NTRN to validators that operate Connect reliably and honestly. This will be coming from the Neutron SubDAO, which will release further details independently.

### **Q: Can I get slashed by using Connect?**

**A:** Not right now - in the first version, there is no slashing or punishment for not running Connect. However, this will change, and the Neutron team has stated that validators that do not run Connect will be jailed.

Right now, the chain node will still be able to participate in consensus without the sidecar, and will begin attaching prices to blocks once Connect is available.

### **Q: Which version of the sidecar binary should I be running?**

**A:** We are currently in the process of designing solutions around giving validators reliable signals for exactly the minimum version of sidecar they need to be running.

In the short term, sidecar version bumps will be scheduled well in advance of any required upgrade and comms will be sent out in the relevant validator channels with the exact version required, and any changes which are relevant to the operator experience.

For future releases we are working with other teams and validators to build automation around version bumps and reasoning about compatibility based on on-chain data. We plan to increase the cadence of updates in line with feature additions, as opposed to batching for larger releases on a longer timeline.

### **Q: Is there a place I can go to get live support?**

**A:** For Connect related issues, join the Skip discord [skip.money/discord](http://skip.money/discord). Follow the onboarding prompts and get certified as a validator—you will be able to join dedicated discord channels based on which chain you are a validator for.

For general issues related to Neutron, your normal support channels remain the same (Neutron Slack and Discord). If you can’t reach anyone from the Skip team for some reason which is critical, the Neutron team will be able to pull us in quickly as well.
