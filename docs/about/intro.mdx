### 🔮 Slinky

Skip builds [Slinky](/slinky/overview), an enshrined oracle for the highest-performance DeFi that leverages your chain's native validator set to provide the fastest, most secure on-chain updates, guaranteed every block.

If you're interested in integrating Slinky, please <b>[contact us](https://skip.money/contact).</b>

### 🧱 Block SDK

We also build the [Block SDK](/blocksdk/overview), an open-source module that gives full control over how blocks are built, including a prebuilt MEV recapture mechanism, a EIP-1559 fee market, and segmentation to tailor blocks to your app-chain use case.

If you're interested in integrating, check out our <b>[integration docs](/blocksdk/0-integrate-the-sdk.md)!</b>
