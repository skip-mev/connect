## Summary

Connect prices are stored within the [`x/oracle`](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/tree/main/x/oracle) module by default.

On very specific chains - right now only dYdX - they live in a different storage module (in dYdX's case, `x/prices`).

These prices are updated on a per-block basis, when there is sufficient difference from the last block's price. They can be accessed natively by CosmWasm smart contracts, by other modules, or by anyone else who has access to chain state.

Connect market configuration is stored in the [`x/marketmap`](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/tree/main/x/marketmap). This module, unlike `x/oracle`, does **not** store price data. Instead, it stores which currency pairs are supported and how they are configured.

### Getting Supported Assets

Every chain will have a different set of supported assets. You can find out which assets are supported on your chain by either running:

1. (via a local running chain): `curl http://localhost:1317/slinky/marketmap/v1/marketmap`
2. (via chain app CLI): `<APP>d q marketmap marketmap`
3. (via gRPC): `grpcurl -plaintext localhost:9090 slinky.marketmap.v1.Query/MarketMap`

This will return a JSON list of supported assets with associated metadata.

### Accessing Connect Prices over node APIs and RPC

To access **all** Connect prices (as of the last committed block), you can run:

1. (via a local running chain): `curl http://localhost:1317/slinky/oracle/v1/get_prices`
2. (via gRPC): `grpcurl -plaintext localhost:9090 slinky.oracle.v1.Query/GetPrices`

To get a **specific** currency pair, you can call:

1. (Get all currency pairs request) `appd q oracle currency-pairs`
2. (Get price request) `appd q oracle price [base] [quote]`

### Price Metadata within Connect

When calling `getPrices` via the above methods, you are returned an array of `GetPriceResponse`, each of which contains the following metadata about individual prices:

1. `QuotePrice`
2. nonce
3. decimals
4. ID

`GetPriceResponse` looks like this:

```
    // GetPriceResponse is the response from the GetPrice grpc method exposed from
    // the x/oracle query service.

    message GetPriceResponse {
        // QuotePrice represents the quote-price for the CurrencyPair given in
        // GetPriceRequest (possibly nil if no update has been made)
        QuotePrice price = 1 [ (gogoproto.nullable) = true ];
        // nonce represents the nonce for the CurrencyPair if it exists in state
        uint64 nonce = 2;
        // decimals represents the number of decimals that the quote-price is
        // represented in. For Pairs where ETHEREUM is the quote this will be 18,
        // otherwise it will be 8.
        uint64 decimals = 3;
        // ID represents the identifier for the CurrencyPair.
        uint64 id = 4;
    }
```

Inside `QuotePrice`, you can fetch for the currency-pair:

1. price
2. timestamp of last update
3. blockheight of last update

`QuotePrice` looks like this:

```
    // QuotePrice is the representation of the aggregated prices for a CurrencyPair,
    // where price represents the price of Base in terms of Quote
    message QuotePrice {
    string price = 1 [
        (cosmos_proto.scalar) = "cosmos.Int",
        (gogoproto.customtype) = "cosmossdk.io/math.Int",
        (gogoproto.nullable) = false
    ];

    // BlockTimestamp tracks the block height associated with this price update.
    // We include block timestamp alongside the price to ensure that smart
    // contracts and applications are not utilizing stale oracle prices
    google.protobuf.Timestamp block_timestamp = 2
        [ (gogoproto.nullable) = false, (gogoproto.stdtime) = true ];

    // BlockHeight is height of block mentioned above
    uint64 block_height = 3;
    }
```

### Connect Price Update Timing

Prices within Connect committed on a one-block delay, since validators use the vote extensions from block `n-1` to securely submit their price data for block `n`.

Most of the time, Connect feeds will update every single block. This happens when there is a non-insignificant update to the price, and over 66% of validators are correctly running their price-fetching sidecar.

However, an individual Connect feed will not update on any given block if:

1. (More common) There was not a sufficient enough change from last block's price to surpass the Connect `min_price_change` parameter. To save network bandwidth, the price won't update.
2. (Less common) The market is disabled (i.e. not updating) within `x/marketmap`
3. (Less common) Less than 2/3s of validators (by stake weight) contributed to a price update. This can happen if not enough validators run the Connect sidecar, or there is a massive, widespread outage across providers.

### Q: Can I get historical prices in Connect?

**A:** No, the `x/oracle` module only stores the most recently posted price. However, you can use blockchain indexers or inspect past blocks to see the prices committed on previous heights.
