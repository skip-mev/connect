## Using Remote Signers <Icon icon="key-skeleton-left-right" />

Remote signers can be used with Connect, however only certain versions are compatible.

### Horcrux

#### Required Version

v3.3.0+

#### With `Horcrux-Proxy`

If you are using horcrux-proxy be sure to use v1.0.0+ so that the maxReadSize can be configured in accordance with larger vote-extension payloads

### TMKMS

#### Required Version
v0.13.1+


## Using Distributed Validators <Icon icon="network-wired" />

Connect can be used within a distributed validator setup. To do so, simply apply the same `app.toml` changes to _each_ validator node.
Head over to [configuration](configuration#application) to see the necessary application-side configurations.
