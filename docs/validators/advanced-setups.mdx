Remote signers can be used with Connect, however only certain versions are compatible.

### Horcrux

#### Required Version

v3.3.0+

#### With `Horcrux-Proxy`

If you are using horcrux-proxy be sure to use v1.0.0+ so that the maxReadSize can be configured in accordance with larger vote-extension payloads

### TMKMS

v0.13.1+


## Using Distributed Validators <Icon icon="network-wired" />

Connect can be used within a distributed validator setup. To do so, simply apply the same `app.toml` changes to _each_ validator node.
Head over to [configuration](configuration#application) to see the necessary application-side configurations.


## dYdX

If you are a dydx validator, you will need some additional configurations to correctly configure your setup.

### Required Connect Version
v1.0.1+

### Connect Flags
In addition to the setup in the [quickstart](quickstart), you will need to pass some additional flags when booting up the Connect sidecar.

```shell
slinky <... your other flags...> --marketmap-provider dydx_api --market-map-endpoint https://<dydx-node REST API endpoint> --oracle-config config_file.json
```

The markets dYdX provides for also require API keys. If you have not received API keys, please reach out in the relevant communication channels. See [API Keys](configuration#api-keys) to learn how to configure them in Connect.

## Neutron

v1.0.3+
