This document serves as a reference for ways to further configure the Connect sidecar, as well as in depth explanations of the application node's configuration.

## Connect Sidecar

Connect can be configured by both flags and environment variables.

### Env Vars

The following values are read via environment variables:

| Key                                              | Default          | Description                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CONNECT_CONFIG_HOST`                            | `"0.0.0.0"`      | The address Connect will serve requests from. WARNING: changing this value requires updating the `oracle_address` in the `app.toml` configuration. |
| `CONNECT_CONFIG_PORT`                            | `"8080"`         | The port Connect will serve requests from. WARNING: changing this value requires updating the `oracle_address` in the `app.toml` configuration.    |
| `CONNECT_CONFIG_METRICS_ENABLED`                 | `"true"`         | Enables prometheus metrics.                                                                                                                        |

## Application Node

The blockchain application is configured under the `[oracle]` heading in your application's `app.toml` file.

```toml app.toml
# ... other sections

[oracle]
# Enabled indicates whether the oracle is enabled.
enabled = "true"

# Oracle Address is the URL of the out of process oracle sidecar. This is used to
# connect to the oracle sidecar when the application boots up.
oracle_address = "CONNECT_ADDRESS_HERE:CONNECT_PORT_HERE" # default Connect port is 8080.

# Client Timeout is the time that the application is willing to wait for responses from
# the oracle before timing out.
client_timeout = "250ms"

# MetricsEnabled determines whether oracle metrics are enabled. Specifically,
# this enables instrumentation of the oracle client and the interaction between
# the oracle and the app.
metrics_enabled = "true"

# PriceTTL is the maximum age of the latest price response before it is considered stale.
# The recommended max age is 10 seconds (10s). If this is greater than 1 minute (1m), the app
# will not start.
price_ttl = "10s"

# Interval is the time between each price update request. The recommended interval
# is the block time of the chain. Otherwise, 1.5 seconds (1500ms) is a good default. If this
# is greater than 1 minute (1m), the app will not start.
interval = "1500ms"
