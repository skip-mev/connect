## Installation


### From GitHub Releases

Head over to our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/releases) page and download the binary that matches your machine's architecture.

### From Source
To install from source, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Go](https://go.dev/).

Enter the commands below to install the binary.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:skip-mev/slinky.git
cd slinky
make install
```

### Verify the Installation
Let's check Connect is properly installed on your machine.
You should see the version printed in your terminal after running the following command:
```shell
slinky version
```

## Run Connect

Running connect is done via the following command:

```shell
slinky
```

### Verify Connect

To verify Connect is working, run the following command:

```shell
curl 'http://localhost:8080/slinky/oracle/v1/prices' | jq .
```

The output of the command should look similar to this:

```json
{
  "prices": {
    "ATOM/USD": "920650000",
    "BITCOIN/USD": "3980283250000",
    "DYDX/USD": "273682500",
    "ETHEREUM/BITCOIN": "5842000",
    "ETHEREUM/USD": "232550500000",
    "POLKADOT/USD": "638800000",
    "SOLANA/USD": "8430350000"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-23T01:15:09.776890Z"
}

```

## Run Chain

In order for the chain binary to get prices from Connect, we need to add the following lines under the `[oracle]` heading to your `app.toml`.

```toml app.toml
[oracle]
enabled = "true"
oracle_address = "localhost:8080"
client_timeout = "250ms"
metrics_enabled = "true"
```

Then, start your chain as normal. To check that the symbiosis between Connect and the chain was successful, head over to METRICS TODO.
