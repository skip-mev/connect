<Info>
    The following instructions assumes you are running a single validator full node with a remote instance of Connect. If you are not running a full node, you do not need to run Connect.
</Info>

This document will guide you through setting up and running Connect, as well as configuring your node to receive data from Connect.

## Installation

### Using Curl

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skip-mev/connect/main/scripts/install.sh | sudo bash
```

### From GitHub Releases

Head over to our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/skip-mev/connect/releases) page and download the binary that matches your machine's architecture.

### From Source

To install from source, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Go](https://go.dev/).

Enter the commands below to install the binary.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:skip-mev/connect.git
cd connect
git checkout $(git describe --tags $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1))
make install
```

## Verify Installation

Let's check Connect is properly installed on your machine.
You should see the version printed in your terminal after running the following command:
```shell
connect version
```

## Run Connect Sidecar

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="General">
        This tab provides general instructions for starting the Connect sidecar.
        If you are running one of the chains listed in the tabs above, please refer to those instructions.
        <QuickStartSnippet />
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="dYdX">
        <QuickStartDYDXSnippet />

    <Tab title="Neutron">
        **The required Connect version for the Neutron chain is `v1.0.12`.**
        <QuickStartSnippet />
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Stargaze">
        <QuickStartStargazeSnippet />
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Warden">

    <Tab title="Initia">
        **The required Connect version for the Initia chain is `v1.0.12`.**
        <QuickStartSnippet />
    </Tab>
</Tabs>



### Verify Connect

To verify Connect is working, run the following command:

```shell
curl 'http://localhost:8080/connect/oracle/v2/prices' | jq .
```

The output of the command should look similar to this:

```json
{
  "prices": {
    "ATOM/USD": "920650000",
    "BITCOIN/USD": "3980283250000",
    "DYDX/USD": "273682500",
    "ETHEREUM/BITCOIN": "5842000",
    "ETHEREUM/USD": "232550500000",
    "POLKADOT/USD": "638800000",
    "SOLANA/USD": "8430350000"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-23T01:15:09.776890Z"
}

```

## Run Application Node

In order for the application to get prices from Connect, we need to add the following lines under the `[oracle]` heading in the `app.toml`.

Remember to change the `oracle_address` value to the address of your Connect sidecar.

```toml app.toml
# ... other sections

[oracle]
enabled = "true" # if you are not running a full node, set this to "false"
oracle_address = "<YOUR_CONNECT_SIDECAR>:8080"
client_timeout = "250ms"
metrics_enabled = "true"
interval = "1500ms"
price_ttl = "10s"
```

Once your `app.toml` is configured, you may start your node as normal.
