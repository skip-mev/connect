## Installation

First things first, lets get Connect on your machine.

### From GitHub Releases

Head over to our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/releases) page and install the binary.

### From Source
To install from source, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Go](https://go.dev/).

Enter the commands below to install the binary.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:skip-mev/slinky.git
cd slinky
make install
```

### Verify the Installation
Let's check Connect is properly installed on your machine.
You should see the version printed in your terminal after running the following command:
```shell
slinky version
````

## Configuration

We need to configure the two sides of Connect before we get connected to data; the chain application, and the oracle.

Lets start with the on-chain config.

<Tip>
    Are you running Connect on a separate machine than your application? Make sure to change the `oracle_address` in the app.toml example below.
</Tip>

### Chain Configuration

Configuration the application to work with Connect, we just need to edit the `app.toml`.

**Example**:

```toml app.toml
# ... other application configurations
[oracle]
enabled = "true"
oracle_address = "localhost:8080"
client_timeout = "250ms"
metrics_enabled = "true"
```

| Key               | Description                                                                                             |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `enabled`         | Whether or not the oracle should be enabled on your infrastructure.                                     |
| `oracle_address`  | The address of the Connect oracle.                                                                      |
| `client_timeout`  | The amount of time the application will wait for a response from the oracle.                            |
| `metrics_enabled` | Set to true if you want metrics emitted from your Connect oracle. See TODO for more details on metrics. |



## 4. Run the Connect Sidecar ✅

You can run connect by running the following command:

```shell
slinky
```

You can verify whether prices are being retrieved by running the following command:

```shell
curl 'http://localhost:8080/slinky/oracle/v1/prices' | jq .
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```JSON
{
  "prices": {
    "ATOM/USD": "920650000",
    "BITCOIN/USD": "3980283250000",
    "DYDX/USD": "273682500",
    "ETHEREUM/BITCOIN": "5842000",
    "ETHEREUM/USD": "232550500000",
    "POLKADOT/USD": "638800000",
    "SOLANA/USD": "8430350000"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-23T01:15:09.776890Z"
}
```

## 5. Start the chain application ✅

Starting the chain application should be no different than starting the application without the sidecar.

```shell
testappd start
```

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues running the oracle sidecar, please see the [Troubleshooting section](validator/troubleshooting.mdx) for more information.
