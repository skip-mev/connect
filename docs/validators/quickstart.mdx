<Info>
    The following instructions assumes you are running a single validator full node with a remote instance of Connect. If you are not running a full node, you do not need to run Connect.
</Info>

This document will guide you through setting up and running Connect, as well as configuring your node to receive data from Connect.

## Installation

### From GitHub Releases

Head over to our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky/releases) page and download the binary that matches your machine's architecture.

### From Source

To install from source, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Go](https://go.dev/).

Enter the commands below to install the binary.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:skip-mev/slinky.git
cd slinky
make install
```

## Verify Installation

Let's check Connect is properly installed on your machine.
You should see the version printed in your terminal after running the following command:
```shell
slinky version
```

## Run Connect Sidecar

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Cosmos SDK Blockchains">
        To run Connect, which starts the service on the default port of `8080`, enter the following command:

        ```shell
        slinky --market-map-endpoint="<YOUR_NODE_GRPC_URL>:<YOUR_NODE_GRPC_PORT>"
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="dYdX Blockchain">
        The dYdX blockchain requires some additional steps to start Connect.

        **The minimum required version for Connect with dYdX is `v1.0.1+`.**

        First, please ensure you've received your API keys for Raydium markets. If you have not received API keys, please reach out to the team in the relevant channels.

        Next, place your API keys under their corresponding URLs in the following file and save it to your system. Keep the file path handy as we will pass it into a flag when running Connect.
        ```json oracle.json
        {
           "providers": {
              "raydium_api": {
                 "api": {
                    "endpoints": [
                       {
                          "url": "https://solana.polkachu.com",
                          "authentication": {
                             "apiKeyHeader": "x-api-key",
                             "apiKey": "API KEY"
                          }
                       },
                       {
                          "url": "https://slinky-solana.kingnodes.com",
                          "authentication": {
                             "apiKeyHeader": "x-api-key",
                             "apiKey": "API KEY"
                          }
                       },
                       {
                          "url": "https://solana.lavenderfive.com",
                          "authentication": {
                             "apiKeyHeader": "x-api-key",
                             "apiKey": "API KEY"
                          }
                       },
                       {
                          "url": "https://solana-rpc.rhino-apis.com",
                          "authentication": {
                             "apiKeyHeader": "x-api-key",
                             "apiKey": "API KEY"
                          }
                       },
                       {
                          "url": "https://dydx.helius-rpc.com",
                          "authentication": {
                             "apiKeyHeader": "x-api-key",
                             "apiKey": "API KEY"
                          }
                       }
                    ]
                 }
              }
           }
        }
        ```
        With your dYdX node's REST API endpoint and the `oracle.json` file path, enter the following command to run Connect.

        ```shell
        slinky --marketmap-provider dydx_api --market-map-endpoint https://<dydx-node REST API endpoint> --oracle-config path/to/oracle.json
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Neutron Blockchain">
        **The minimum required Connect version for the Neutron chain is `v1.0.3+`.**

        To run Connect, which starts the service on the default port of `8080`, enter the following command:
        ```shell
        slinky --market-map-endpoint="<YOUR_NODE_GRPC_URL>:<YOUR_NODE_GRPC_PORT>"
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>



### Verify Connect

To verify Connect is working, run the following command:

```shell
curl 'http://localhost:8080/slinky/oracle/v1/prices' | jq .
```

The output of the command should look similar to this:

```json
{
  "prices": {
    "ATOM/USD": "920650000",
    "BITCOIN/USD": "3980283250000",
    "DYDX/USD": "273682500",
    "ETHEREUM/BITCOIN": "5842000",
    "ETHEREUM/USD": "232550500000",
    "POLKADOT/USD": "638800000",
    "SOLANA/USD": "8430350000"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-23T01:15:09.776890Z"
}

```

## Run Application Node

In order for the application to get prices from Connect, we need to add the following lines under the `[oracle]` heading in the `app.toml`.

Remember to change the `oracle_address` value to the address of your Connect sidecar.

```toml app.toml
# ... other sections

[oracle]
enabled = "true"
oracle_address = "<YOUR_CONNECT_SIDECAR>:8080"
client_timeout = "250ms"
metrics_enabled = "true"
interval = "1500ms"
price_ttl = "10s"
```

Once your `app.toml` is configured, you may start your node as normal.
