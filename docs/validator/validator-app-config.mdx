# Application Configurations

This page gives an overview of the configuration options for the applications' oracle service and its corresponding metrics instrumentation.

<Info>
  Validators running on a network that supports the oracle **must** run the oracle side-car.
</Info>

## Example App Configuration

The `app.toml` file is the configuration file that is consumed by the application. This file contains over-arching configurations for your entire Cosmos SDK application, as well as a few new configurations for the oracle. You must use this template to add the oracle configurations to your `app.toml` file:

```toml

###                                  Oracle                                 ###
###############################################################################
[oracle]
# Enabled indicates whether the oracle is enabled.
enabled = "{{ .Oracle.Enabled }}"

# Oracle Address is the URL of the out of process oracle sidecar. This is used to
# connect to the oracle sidecar when the application boots up. Note that the address
# can be modified at any point, but will only take effect after the application is
# restarted. This can be the address of an oracle container running on the same
# machine or a remote machine.
oracle_address = "{{ .Oracle.OracleAddress }}"

# Client Timeout is the time that the client is willing to wait for responses from
# the oracle before timing out.
client_timeout = "{{ .Oracle.ClientTimeout }}"
