## Troubleshooting FAQs

We are in the process of building up our core documentation around operational issues and troubleshooting. For now, we are available 24/7 for any questions.
The fastest way to reach us is by emailing <b>support@skip.money</b>

<b>Can I run Slinky on the same machine as my validator?</b>

Yes, you can run it anywhere - but please defer to any chain-specific recommendations if there are any!

<b>Can I get slashed for running Slinky?</b>

Not usually. If a chain uses Slinky and requires oracle prices to be posted, running the Slinky sidecar is the best way to avoid downtime or incorrect prices.
For more information, check out the [Incentivization Docs](/general/slashing.mdx).

Many chains will reward good operation of Slinky with additional validator yield, make sure to ask the team!

<b>Does Slinky take up a lot of resources?</b>

No, it's a very lightweight binary.

<b>Can I contribute to Slinky?</b>

Yes - feel free to contribute via opening an issue in [our repo](https://github.com/skip-mev/docs)!
