# Overview

Flags allow you to customize the behavior of `slinky` to suit your needs.

## Connecting to a Node

### marketmap-provider

> If you are serving prices for the `dydx` network, you should be using the `dydx_api` provider. Otherwise, you should be using the `marketmap_api` provider.

This flag allows you to specify how `slinky` should be looking for the markets it will be serving prices for. There are two options available:

**If your sidecar is serving prices for the `dydx` network**, run your sidecar with the following argument

```bash
# If your sidecar is serving prices for the dydx network
slinky --marketmap-provider dydx_api
```

By default this assumes that the dydx node's REST endpoint is running at `http://localhost:1317`. If you need to change this, please utilize the [market-map-endpoint](/validator/flags-guide.mdx#market-map-endpoint) flag.

If you are serving prices for any other network, you should be using the `marketmap_api` (which is the default `slinky` is using).

```bash
# If you are serving prices for any other network
slinky
```

By default this assumes that the node's app GRPC endpoint is running at `localhost:9090`. If you need to change this, please utilize the [market-map-endpoint](/validator/flags-guide.mdx#market-map-endpoint) flag.

### market-map-endpoint

> The `marketmap_api` provider must always point to the app GRPC endpoint (typically port 9090), while the `dydx_api` provider must always point to the REST endpoint (typically port 1317).

This flag allows you to specify where `slinky` should be looking for the markets it will be serving prices for. By default, `slinky` assumes `localhost:9090` for the `marketmap_api` provider and `localhost:1317` for the `dydx_api` provider.

To change the default behavior, you can run `slinky` with the following arguments:

```bash
# Pointing your sidecar to a custom node's app GRPC/REST endpoint
slinky --market-map-endpoint <host>:<port>
```

## Logging

### log-std-out-level

> By default, `slinky` prints logs at the `info` level.

This flag allows you to specify the level of logs that should be printed to the standard output. By default, `slinky` prints logs at the `info` level. To change this, you can run `slinky` with the following arguments:

```bash
slinky --log-std-out-level <level>
```

Accepted levels are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`. **Note that debug logs are verbose and should only be used for debugging purposes.**

### log-file-level

> By default, `slinky` writes logs at the `info` level.

This flag allows you to specify the level of logs that should be written to the log file. By default, `slinky` writes logs at the `info` level. To change this, you can run `slinky` with the following arguments:

```bash
slinky --log-file-level <level>
```

Accepted levels are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`. **Note that debug logs are verbose and should only be used for debugging purposes.**

### log-file

> By default, `slinky` writes logs to `stdout` and to a rotating log file - `sidecar.log` - located in the same directory as the binary.

This flag allows you to specify the path to the log file where logs should be written. By default, `slinky` writes logs to `stdout` and to a rotating log file located in the same directory as the binary (e.g., `sidecar.log`). To change this, you can run `slinky` with the following arguments:

```bash
slinky --log-file <path>
```

### log-max-size

> By default, `slinky` rotates the log file when it reaches 100MB.

This flag allows you to specify the maximum size of the log file before it is rotated. By default, `slinky` rotates the log file when it reaches 100MB. To change this, you can run `slinky` with the following arguments:

```bash
# Rotates the log file when it reaches 200MB
slinky --log-max-size 200
```

### log-max-backups

> By default, `slinky` keeps 1 backup of the log file.

This flag allows you to specify the maximum number of log file backups that should be kept. By default, `slinky` keeps 1 backup of the log file. To change this, you can run `slinky` with the following arguments:

```bash
# Keeps 3 backups of the log file
slinky --log-max-backups 3
```

### log-max-age

> By default, `slinky` keeps log files for 3 days.

This flag allows you to specify the maximum number of days that log files should be kept. By default, `slinky` keeps log files for 3 days. To change this, you can run `slinky` with the following arguments:

```bash
# Keeps log files for 7 days
slinky --log-max-age 7
```

### log-file-disable-compression

> By default, `slinky` compresses log files after rotation. Meaning backups are compressed.

This flag allows you to specify whether log files should be compressed after rotation. By default, `slinky` compresses log files after rotation. To disable this behavior, you can run `slinky` with the following arguments:

```bash
# Disables log file compression
slinky --log-file-disable-compression
```

### log-disable-file-rotation

> By default, `slinky` stores logs in a rotating log file on disk.

This flag allows you to specify whether logs should be stored in a rotating log file on disk. By default, `slinky` stores logs in a rotating log file. To disable this behavior, you can run `slinky` with the following arguments:

```bash
# Disables log file rotation
slinky --log-disable-file-rotation
```

## Miscellaneous

### update-market-config-path

> By default, `slinky` does not write the markets it is serving prices for to a file.

This flag allows you to specify the path to a file where `slinky` should write the markets it is serving prices for. By default, `slinky` does not write the markets it is serving prices for to a file. To change this, you can run `slinky` with the following arguments:

```bash
# Writes the markets to a file located at /path/to/file
slinky --update-market-config-path /path/to/file
```
