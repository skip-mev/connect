A general purpose price oracle leveraging ABCI++.

## Install

```shell
$ go install github.com/skip-mev/slinky
```

## Overview

The slinky repository is composed of the following core packages:

* **abci** - This package contains the [vote extension](./abci/ve/README.md), [proposal](./abci/proposals/README.md), and [preblock handlers](./abci/preblock/oracle/README.md) that are used to broadcast oracle data to the network and to store it in the blockchain.
* **oracle** - This [package](./oracle/) contains the main oracle that aggregates external data sources before broadcasting it to the network. You can reference the provider documentation [here](./providers/base/README.md) to get a high level overview of how the oracle works.
* **providers** - This package contains a collection of [web socket](./providers/websockets/README.md) and [API](./providers/apis/README.md) based data providers that are used by the oracle to collect external data. 
* **x/oracle** - This package contains a Cosmos SDK module that allows you to store oracle data on a blockchain.
* **x/alerts** - This package contains a Cosmos SDK module that allows network participants to create alerts when oracle data that is in violation of some condition is broadcast to the network and stored on the blockchain.
* **x/sla** - This package contains a Cosmos SDK module that allows you to create service level agreements (SLAs) that can be used to incentivize network participants to consistently, reliably provide data with high uptime.

## Usage

To run the oracle, run the following command:

```bash
$ make run-oracle-server
```

To check the current aggregated prices, open a new terminal and run the following command:

```bash
$ make run-oracle-client
```

To see all network metrics, open a new terminal and run the following command and then navigate to http://localhost:9090:

```bash
$ make run-prom-client
```

To add a new provider, update the local config in [config/local/main.go](./config/local/main.go) and then run the following command:

```bash
$ make update-local-config
```

## Future Work

The oracle side car is a combination of the oracle and provider packages. This is being moved to a [separate repository](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky-sidecar).
