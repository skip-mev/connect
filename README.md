A general purpose price oracle leveraging ABCI++.

## Install

```shell
$ go install github.com/skip-mev/slinky
```

## Overview

The slinky repository is composed of the following core packages:

* **abci** - This package contains the [vote extension](./abci/ve/README.md), [proposal](./abci/proposals/README.md), and [preblock handlers](./abci/preblock/oracle/README.md) that are used to broadcast oracle data to the network and to store it in the blockchain.
* **oracle** - This [package](./oracle/) contains the main oracle that aggregates external data sources before broadcasting it to the network. You can reference the provider documentation [here](./providers/base/README.md) to get a high level overview of how the oracle works.
* **providers** - This package contains a collection of [websocket](./providers/websockets/README.md) and [API](./providers/apis/README.md) based data providers that are used by the oracle to collect external data. 
* **x/oracle** - This package contains a Cosmos SDK module that allows you to store oracle data on a blockchain.
* **x/alerts** - This package contains a Cosmos SDK module that allows network participants to create alerts when oracle data that is in violation of some condition is broadcast to the network and stored on the blockchain.
* **x/sla** - This package contains a Cosmos SDK module that allows you to create service level agreements (SLAs) that can be used to incentivize network participants to consistently, reliably provide data with high uptime.

## Usage

### Running the Oracle Sidecar

To run the oracle, run the following command:

```bash
$ make run-oracle-server
```

To check the current aggregated prices, open a new terminal and run the following command:

```bash
$ curl localhost:8080/slinky/oracle/v1/prices
```

To see all network metrics, open a new terminal and run the following command and then navigate to http://localhost:9090:

```bash
$ make run-prom-client
```

### Running a Local Blockchain

To run a local blockchain, first start the oracle server and then run the following command (in a separate window):

```bash
$ make build-and-start-app
```

To see the prices that are being written to the blockchain, run the following command (in a separate window) where you have the slinky binary built (e.g. `./slinky/build/slinkyd`):

```bash
./slinkyd q oracle price BITCOIN USD
```

Result: 

```bash
decimals: "8"
id: "0"
nonce: "44"
price:
  block_height: "46"
  block_timestamp: "2024-01-29T01:43:48.735542Z"
  price: "4221100000000"
```

## Metrics

### Oracle Service Metrics

* metrics relevant to the oracle service's health + operation are [here](./oracle/metrics/README.md)
* metrics relevant to the operation / health of the oracle's providers are [here](./providers/base/metrics/README.md)

### Oracle Application / Network Metrics

* metrics relevant to the network's (that is running the instance slinky) performance are [here](./service/metrics/README.md)

## Basic Perfomance Analysis

> **Note: These are numbers based on 14 providers and 9 currency pairs over a 24 hour period.**

* ~**5 milliseconds** between price updates across all providers and price feeds.
* ~**14 million** total price updates.
* ~**60 go routines** are running at any given time.
* ~**7x** improvement in performance of websocket providers over API providers.

To test these numbers yourself, spin up the the oracle server following the instructions above and then navigate to http://localhost:9090. From here, you can run the prometheus queries defined in the packages below to get insight into the oracle's performance.

* [Oracle Graphs & Queries](./oracle/metrics/README.md#usage): Provides insight into the oracle's performance by provider, price feed, and currency pair. All includes nice visualizations of the oracle's aggregated prices and the individual prices that are aggregated to produce the oracle's aggregated prices.
* [Data Provider Queries](./providers/base/metrics/README.md#usage): Provides general insight into how often price feeds are updated by status (success/failure), provider (binance, coinbase, etc.), price feed (BTC/USD, ETH/USD), and provider type (api/websocket).
* [Websocket Performance Queries](./providers/base/websocket/metrics/README.md#usage): Provides insight into how often websocket providers are successfully updating their data. This is a combination of metrics related to the underlying connection as well as the data handler which is responsible for processing the data received from the Websocket connection.
* [API Performance Queries](./providers/base/api/metrics/README.md#usage): Provides insight into how often API providers are successfully updating their data.

## Future Work

The oracle side car is a combination of the oracle and provider packages. This is being moved to a [separate repository](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky-sidecar).
