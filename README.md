A general purpose price oracle leveraging ABCI++.

## Install

```shell
$ go install github.com/skip-mev/slinky
```

## Overview

The slinky repository is composed of the following core packages:

* **abci** - This package contains the [vote extension](./abci/ve/README.md), [proposal](./abci/proposals/README.md), and [preblock handlers](./abci/preblock/oracle/README.md) that are used to broadcast oracle data to the network and to store it in the blockchain.
* **oracle** - This [package](./oracle/) contains the main oracle that aggregates external data sources before broadcasting it to the network. You can reference the provider documentation [here](./providers/base/README.md) to get a high level overview of how the oracle works.
* **providers** - This package contains a collection of [websocket](./providers/websockets/README.md) and [API](./providers/apis/README.md) based data providers that are used by the oracle to collect external data. 
* **x/oracle** - This package contains a Cosmos SDK module that allows you to store oracle data on a blockchain.
* **x/alerts** - This package contains a Cosmos SDK module that allows network participants to create alerts when oracle data that is in violation of some condition is broadcast to the network and stored on the blockchain.
* **x/sla** - This package contains a Cosmos SDK module that allows you to create service level agreements (SLAs) that can be used to incentivize network participants to consistently, reliably provide data with high uptime.

## Usage

### Running the Oracle Sidecar

To run the oracle, run the following command:

```bash
$ make run-oracle-server
```

To check the current aggregated prices, open a new terminal and run the following command:

```bash
$ curl localhost:8080/slinky/oracle/v1/prices
```

To see all network metrics, open a new terminal and run the following command and then navigate to http://localhost:9090:

```bash
$ make run-prom-client
```

### Running a Local Blockchain

To run a local blockchain, first start the oracle server and then run the following command (in a separate window):

```bash
$ make build-and-start-app
```

To see the prices that are being written to the blockchain, run the following command (in a separate window) where you have the slinky binary built (e.g. `./slinky/build/slinkyd`):

```bash
./slinkyd q oracle price BITCOIN USD
```

Result: 

```bash
decimals: "8"
id: "0"
nonce: "44"
price:
  block_height: "46"
  block_timestamp: "2024-01-29T01:43:48.735542Z"
  price: "4221100000000"
```

## Metrics

### Oracle Service Metrics

* metrics relevant to the oracle service's health + operation are [here](./oracle/metrics/README.md)
* metrics relevant to the operation / health of the oracle's providers are [here](./providers/base/metrics/README.md)

### Oracle Application / Network Metrics

* metrics relevant to the network's (that is running the instance slinky) performance are [here](./service/metrics/README.md)

## Future Work

The oracle side car is a combination of the oracle and provider packages. This is being moved to a [separate repository](https://github.com/skip-mev/slinky-sidecar).
