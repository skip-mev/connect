# Oracle Price Conversion Aggregation

## Overview

The aggregation function defined in this package is used to convert a set of price feeds into a common set of prices. This is done by converting all prices to a common decimal precision and then aggregating the prices based on the price feed conversions defined for each price feed. Note that only tickers that provide an optional set of Paths will be considered for the following conversion aggregation. If a ticker does not have a set of paths, the final price outputted will be the median of the price feeds.

## Conversion

Say that the oracle is configured to fetch prices for the following feeds:

* BITCOIN/USDT (8 decimal precision)
* BITCOIN/USDC (8 decimal precision)
* ETHEREUM/USDT (18 decimal precision)
* ETHEREUM/USDC (18 decimal precision)
* USDT/USD (6 decimal precision)
* USDC/USD (6 decimal precision)

We care about calculating the price of BITCOIN and ETHEREUM in USD. To do this, we need to convert all prices to a common decimal precision - [`ScaledDecimals`](./utils.go). We choose 36 decimal precision as the common precision - primarily to retain the maximum precision possible. The conversion is done as follows:

* BITCOIN/USDT: 8 -> 36
* BITCOIN/USDC: 8 -> 36
* ETHEREUM/USDT: 18 -> 36
* ETHEREUM/USDC: 18 -> 36
* USDT/USD: 6 -> 36
* USDC/USD: 6 -> 36

## Aggregation

The main oracle configuration contains a [list of valid price conversions per desired price feed](./../../../oracle/config/README.md#aggregate-market-configurations). For example, to calculate the price of BITCOIN in USD, we need to convert the price of BITCOIN/USDT to USD, and the price of BITCOIN/USDC to USD. If the list contains multiple valid conversions, the aggregation function will return the median of the prices - where an average is taken if the number of prices is even.

Following the example above, the aggregation function will return the median of the following prices:

* BITCOIN/USDT * USDT/USD -> BITCOIN/USD
* BITCOIN/USDC * USDC/USD -> BITCOIN/USD

* ETHEREUM/USDT * USDT/USD -> ETHEREUM/USD
* ETHEREUM/USDC * USDC/USD -> ETHEREUM/USD
