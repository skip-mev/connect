# CoinMarketCap Provider

## Overview

The CoinMarketCap provider is used to fetch the spot price for cryptocurrencies from the [CoinMarketCap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/). This provider can only be configured to fetch with an API key. This API is good for benchmarking prices from exchanges and the index price of the sidecar.
