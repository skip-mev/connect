# Kraken Provider

## Kraken

The Kraken provider is used to fetch the spot price for cryptocurrencies from the [Kraken API](https://docs.kraken.com/rest/#tag/Spot-Market-Data/operation/getTickerInformation).

## Supported Pairs

To determine the pairs (in the form `BASEQUOTE`) currencies that the Binance provider supports, you can run the following command:

```bash
$ curl "https://api.kraken.com/0/public/Ticker        
```
