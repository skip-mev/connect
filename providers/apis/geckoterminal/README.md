# GeckoTerminal Provider

## Overview

The GeckoTerminal provider is used to fetch the spot price for tokens on a variety of blockchains, pools, decentralized exchanges, and other sources. This provider can be configured to fetch with or without an API key. Note that without an API key, it is very likely that the GeckoTerminal API will rate limit your requests (30 requests per minute).
