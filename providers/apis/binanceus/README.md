# BinanceUS Provider

## Overview

The Binance US provider is used to fetch the spot price for cryptocurrencies from the [Binance API](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#general-info).

> **NOTE:** This provider inherits from the Binance provider but uses the Binance US endpoints instead for those who are
> geo-restricted.  For more info on the Binance Provider its [documentation](../binance/README.md).
